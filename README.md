## Project Overview

This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. By analyzing various features such as age, gender, and class, we can build a model that accurately predicts survival rates.

To get started, download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/amansiwach868/titanic-survival-prediction/releases) and execute the necessary files.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers. It includes various features such as:

- PassengerId
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (number of parents/children aboard)
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (port of embarkation)

This dataset is available on Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.

## Features

- **Binary Classification**: The model predicts two outcomes: survival or non-survival.
- **Confusion Matrix**: To evaluate the model's performance.
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of the dataset.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve model accuracy.
- **Logistic Regression**: The main algorithm used for prediction.
- **ROC Curve**: To visualize the performance of the classification model.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amansiwach868/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the main script to start the prediction process. Execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can modify the parameters in the script to customize the analysis and prediction.

## Data Analysis and Cleaning

Data analysis is a crucial step in understanding the dataset. Here are the key steps involved:

1. **Loading the Data**: Use Pandas to load the dataset into a DataFrame.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
3. **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and fill or drop missing values.
4. **Outlier Detection**: Use statistical methods to identify and handle outliers.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering helps improve model performance. Some techniques used in this project include:

- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical variables into numerical values.
- **Creating New Features**: Combine existing features to create new ones, such as family size from SibSp and Parch.
- **Scaling Features**: Normalize or standardize features for better model performance.

## Model Training

The model training process involves:

1. **Splitting the Data**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. **Training the Model**: Use logistic regression to train the model on the training set.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model parameters for better accuracy.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model's performance, we use:

- **Confusion Matrix**: To visualize true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
- **Accuracy Score**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
- **ROC Curve**: To visualize the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

## Results

The results of the model can be found in the output files generated after running the script. You can also visualize the results using graphs and charts for better understanding.
